# Furuta (Rotary) Inverted Pendulum  
**Modeling, Control, and Hardware-in-the-Loop Implementation**

## Overview
This project presents the **control, simulation, and experimental validation** of a **Furuta (rotary) inverted pendulum**, a classic nonlinear and inherently unstable control system.

The system dynamics are taken directly from a well-established reference in the literature and linearized around the upright equilibrium. Control is achieved using **modern control techniques**, primarily the **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**. Validation is performed through **MATLAB/Simulink simulations**, **Simscape Multibody modeling**, and **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)** experiments using an Arduino-based setup.
